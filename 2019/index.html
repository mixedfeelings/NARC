          					Drawing from the writings of John Z. Komurki, Steven Shaviro, and Mark Fisher, Reif’s in-progress study, On the Commercial Subsumption of Subcultural Print, attempts to locate the Risograph print within a post-digital production landscape, specifically at a pivotal opening between subcultural publishing and commercial-corporate subsumption. Reif’s work here comprises an initial aesthetic analysis and a consideration of the Risograph’s “virtuous” refashioning at the hands of Facebook and Urban Outfitters.

                     Jessica Williams-Holmberg  is an Oslo-based artist and publisher. She started working with Riso in 2011 and was key to the establishment of the Self-Publishing Workshop at the Oslo National Academy of the Arts. Between 2011 and 2014, she was the driving force behind NSEW Press and since 2016 has run the publisher and Risograph studio Hverdag Books. In 2018, she co-founded Norsk Risoforening (Norwegian Risograph Society) along with Ann-Kristin Stølan and Benjamin Hickeither.

                  <p class="">
                    As an artist, she has exhibited widely and her working methods are like those of a hunter/gatherer—which is a nice way of saying she often works with trash. Everything from institutional language, mass-produced consumer goods, internet scraps, and physical debris finds its way into her work. She is also an avid collaborator, often involving others in her works. The machines that have passed through her studios in chronological order: RZ220, MZ790, CV3230.

  					         Drawing from the writings of John Z. Komurki, Steven Shaviro, and Mark Fisher, Reif’s in-progress study, On the Commercial Subsumption of Subcultural Print, attempts to locate the Risograph print within a post-digital production landscape, specifically at a pivotal opening between subcultural publishing and commercial-corporate subsumption. Reif’s work here comprises an initial aesthetic analysis and a consideration of the Risograph’s “virtuous” refashioning at the hands of Facebook and Urban Outfitters.

                     Jessica Williams-Holmberg is an Oslo-based artist and publisher. She started working with Riso in 2011 and was key to the establishment of the Self-Publishing Workshop at the Oslo National Academy of the Arts. Between 2011 and 2014, she was the driving force behind NSEW Press and since 2016 has run the publisher and Risograph studio Hverdag Books.

                  <p>
                    As an artist, she has exhibited widely and her working methods are like those of a hunter/gatherer—which is a nice way of saying she often works with trash. Everything from institutional language, mass-produced consumer goods, internet scraps, and physical debris finds its way into her work. She is also an avid collaborator, often involving others in her works. The machines that have passed through her studios in chronological order: RZ220, MZ790, CV3230.
